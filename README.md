## Introduction
The data set is an image captioning data set with complex construction activity scenes as the background. The dataset collected a total of 13,119 photos, recruited 15 civil engineering students to manually annotate the pictures, and generated 65594 descriptions in total, including activity descriptions of construction machinery and construction workers, and identification descriptions of unsafe behaviors of workers on construction sites. It involves earthworks, rebar work and masonry.

The key differences between this dataset and others are: (1) It includes both machinery and worker construction activities, validating the image captioning algorithm on two of the most common architectural research subjects. (2) The image descriptions provide detailed categorization of workers' safety equipment to facilitate unsafe behavior detection. (3) The dataset was collected offline to ensure data authenticity and validity, with a larger volume of data. (4) The study also evaluates a newer image captioning model on this dataset, comparing its performance with classical models.
